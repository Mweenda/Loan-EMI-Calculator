---

## THE FASTEST PATH FORWARD

### Step 1: Authorization (Right Now)
```
Senior Researcher reads:
  → EXECUTIVE_STATUS_REPORT.md (5 min)
  → FRAMEWORK_COMPLETE.md (5 min)
  
Decision: GO / NO-GO
Send signal to team lead
```

### Step 2: Team Briefing (Next 30 min)
```
Tech Lead sends to team:
  → This document
  → EXECUTION_DASHBOARD_PHASE_1.md
  → MVP_ROADMAP.md (Feature 1.1 section)
  
Developers: Read and understand specs
```

### Step 3: Feature Branch Setup (Next 15 min)
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/phase-1-core-engine
```

### Step 4: Feature 1.1 Implementation (Next 90 min)
```bash
# Edit: packages/shared/src/index.ts
# Copy template from MVP_ROADMAP.md
# Implement calculateEMI function
# Run: pnpm test
# Verify: Benchmark = 8,884.88
```

### Step 5: Green Test by 4:00 PM UTC (CRITICAL)
```bash
pnpm typecheck    # ✅ Must pass
pnpm lint         # ✅ Must pass
pnpm format       # ✅ Must pass
pnpm test         # ✅ Must pass (green checkmarks)

# Screenshot the terminal output
# Post to team Slack: "Feature 1.1 green test passed ✅"
```

---

## SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE THIS

**By 4:00 PM UTC, you need to post:**

```
✅ calculateEMI function implemented
✅ Zod schema ready (partially done)
✅ First benchmark test passing (8,884.88 verified)
✅ All checks green:
   - pnpm typecheck ✅
   - pnpm lint ✅
   - pnpm format ✅
   - pnpm test ✅
```

**This screenshot is your proof of being on-track for Phase 1 success.**

---

## IF YOU GET STUCK

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Fix**: Run `pnpm typecheck --pretty`, read error details, add type annotations

### Issue: Test not running
**Fix**: Check syntax, run `pnpm test -- --reporter=verbose`, verify import paths

### Issue: Benchmark value doesn't match
**Fix**: Check formula in MVP_ROADMAP.md, verify r = annualRate / (12 * 100), test manually

### Issue: Can't find code template
**Fix**: Open `docs/MVP_ROADMAP.md`, search "Feature 1.1", copy code block

### Issue: Stuck >20 minutes
**Action**: Post in team Slack immediately. Don't wait alone.

✅ Ship Phase 1 in 3 days (not 2 weeks)  
✅ Have zero regressions (not 15)  
✅ Build sustainable patterns (not tech debt)  
✅ Grow as engineers (not just code)  
✅ Ship a production MVP (not a prototype)
